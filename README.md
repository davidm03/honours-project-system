# Honours Project System 2021

## About

The Honours Project system is a full-stack web application developed with MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js (MERN) with the aim of improving the honours project module at universities and helping to connect students with projects or supervisors. 

## How to Run Locally

3. Navigate to the 'honours-project-system/client' directory and run `npm install`
